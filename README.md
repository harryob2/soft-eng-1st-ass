# soft-eng-1st-ass

So this is my submission for our first assignment in software engineering 2020. I decided to do it
mostly in python because it's a language I've wanted to learn for a while, and is a language I hope
to use in the future on personal projects. 

Go through the history of my commits to see how it has evolved overtime. Most of my work is done in
chunks during 2-4 hour EDM-powered sessions.
